# name-that-brewery
Calling all craft-beer lovers!

So, you think you know craft beer, huh? Test your knowledge here!

You will be shown a series of 50 cards, each with a different beer can on it showing the
title of a specific craft brew. You will be given four brewery names and it is your task
to identify the brewery that makes the beer named in the graphic. To win, you must accurately
identify 80% of the brews. Good Luck!

Build Plan:
1) Build design - HTML/CSS, see wireframe
2) Create beer cards
3) Add functionality
  - create array of objects with all of the images, choices and answers
  - display random question, render the image and the options
  - make choices buttons work, make sure the function works for specific answers
  - set pop up to determine if answer was correct or incorrect
  - create "next question" button, only available once an answer is clicked
  - set score counter update based on correct answers
  - once all questions are answered render modal that displays either "You Won..." or "Not quite,..."
  - create modal to display win or lose
